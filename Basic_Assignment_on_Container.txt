31. Create a new ubuntu container out of the same image as that previous container in attached mode.
--> docker run --name=ab ubuntu:rolling sleep 1000

32. Login as a root user
--> docker exec -it ab bash

33. Check if you can see the file created in previous container, you will not see the file as well as software that you installed in the previous container. Now kill this Container.
-->ls
No

34. Do you have the previous ubuntu container where you created the file and installed the software? If no reapeat step 25 to 29.
-->yes

35. Create an Image out of the existing container.
-->docker commit abc ubuntu_new

36. Now Create a Container out of this image and login into it to see if you can see the file and software installed by you in the previous container.

yes it exists

37. Do you have running tomcat container? If yes, Stop it and kill all tomcat container.
-->no

38. Create an index.html file with following code in it:-

cd webapps
mkdir ROOT
cd ROOT
touch index.html
vi index.html
<h1>Hello world</h1>
exit

39. type below command:-
	docker images --help
Now, try to run command that proves the concept of following three options:-
1. -a
2. -f
3. -q

write atleast 1 command using each option above and prove their concepts as described in the --help.
---> docker images --help
docker images -a  ======> shows all images

docker ps -a ===> shows all containers
docker ps --filter "name=tom"===> shows container with name tom
docker ps -s ===> shows file sizes
docker ps -l ===> shows latest container
docker ps -n ===> shows n latest containers

2. create
3. export
4. history

9. save
10. stats
11. top
--> docker --help
docker cp "d:/index.txt" "/usr/local" ==> copies from local to contaainer
docker create tomcat:7 ==> creates new container for image
docker export ubuntu_new > latest.tar ===> export content in directory as tar
docker history ubuntu_new ===> shows history of that image
docker info ==> display all info about system
docker login ===> login to docker registry
docker logout ===> logout from docker registry
docker rename tom tomas ===> renames container
docker save tomas > tom.tar ===> Save one or more images to a tar 
docker stats tomas ===> Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics
docker top tomas ===> Display the running processes of a container

42. Kill all running container in one liner command.
--> docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

43. Delete all images in one liner command.
--> docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)


44. Create a simple Dockerfile, build it and run it.
--> FROM openjdk:8
      ENTRYPOINT ["java","-version"]

45. Create one or more Dockerfile that demostrate the following commands in Dockerfile (Write a PoC for each in one or more Dockerfile)
	1. USER
	2. RUN
	3. ENV
	4. CMD
	5. RUN
	6. ENTRYPOINT
	7. EXPOSE
	8. VOLUME
-->


46. Dockerhub:-
	Find a application you care about on docker hub.
	Launch the container.
	Install another application in it.
	Save (commit) the image.
	Upload that to docker hub in your account and share it with a colleague, ask them to use your image and run the container out of it in their machine/vm.
--> docker pull ubuntu:rolling
      docker run --name=new-ubuntu ubuntu:rolling sleep 1000
      apt-get update
      apt-get install nodejs
      exit
      docker commit new-ubuntu
      docker push shivakrishna1236/new-ubuntu
